# Youtube_videos_analysis

## Within this project, I would like to explore the following:

- Getting to know Youtube API and how to obtain video data.
- Analyzing video data and verify different common "myths" about what makes a video do well on Youtube, for example:
  + Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?
  + Does the video duration matter for views and interaction (likes/ comments)?
  + Does title length matter for views?
  + How many tags do good performing videos have? What are the common tags among these videos?
  + Across all the creators I take into consideration, how often do they upload new videos? On which days in the week?
- Explore the trending topics using NLP techniques
  + Which popular topics are being covered in the videos (e.g. using wordcloud for video titles)?
  + Which questions are being asked in the comment sections in the videos

## Steps of the project

1. Obtain video meta data via Youtube API for the top 10-15 channels in the gaming niche (this includes several small steps: create a developer key, request data and transform the responses into a usable data format)
2. Prepocess data and engineer additional features for analysis
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Conclusions
